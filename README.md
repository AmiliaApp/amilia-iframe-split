Amilia IFRAME Split - Proof of Concept
======================================

This site demonstrates a proof of concept for integrating separate iframed pieces into a customer site:
- Cart (top right)
- Add to cart (pop up)

The Website would be fed using the API. When a customer clicks on Add to Cart, a popup would appear with an iframed add to cart feature.
That in turn would feed the iframed cart on the website. The checkout still occurs on a separate iframe page.

Work in progress, of course.
